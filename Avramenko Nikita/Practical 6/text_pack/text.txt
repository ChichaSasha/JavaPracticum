Quite often the above mentioned polynomial hash is good enough, and no collisions will happen during tests. 
Remember, the probability that collision happens is only ≈1m. For m=109+9 the probability is ≈10−9 which is quite low. 
But notice, that we only did one comparison. What if we compared a string s with 106 different strings. The probability that at least one collision happens is now ≈10−3. 
And if we want to compare 106 different strings with each other (e.g. by counting how many unique strings exists), then the probability of at least one collision happening is already ≈1. 
It is pretty much guaranteed that this task will end with a collision and returns the wrong result.
